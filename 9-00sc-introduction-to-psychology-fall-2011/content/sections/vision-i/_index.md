Describe in detail the pathway that transmits visual information from the eye to the primary vision areas in the brain. Also describe the function of each component of the eye when processing visual information.

› _View/hide answer_

Light enters through the cornea, which begins to focus the light. The light passes through the pupil and through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina. Retina cells called rods and cones begin to process visual information. Rods respond black, white, and gray colors. Rods do not provide much detail of an image, but respond well in dim light and are important for peripheral vision. Cones respond to color and can detect fine details in an image. Cones respond most to bright light and are mostly located in the center of the retina, called the fovea. Visual information then passes through the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. From there the visual information is transmitted down the optic nerve to the thalamus, and finally to primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe.
