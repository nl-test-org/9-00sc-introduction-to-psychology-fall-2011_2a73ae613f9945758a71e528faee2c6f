Discussion: Thinking & Intelligence
-----------------------------------

This discussion section covers thinking and intelligence. We'll discuss two topics: whether we think in words or pictures, and some approaches to creative problem solving… [Read more »]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/intelligence/discussion-thinking-intelligence)

### Short Answer Questions

1) What is intelligence? What is IQ? How are they related?

› _Sample Answer_

_Intelligence_, as it is understood in psychological science, is "the ability to reason and solve problems well and to understand and learn complex material" (Kosslyn & Rosenberg, 2011).

_IQ_ (intelligence quotient) is a score on an intelligence test, based on population and age norms.

In many cases, IQ is used as a measure (index) of intelligence, although intelligence is a complex and multifaceted construct, whereas IQ is a single number over many factors.

2) What are some examples of how IQ scores relate to real-world performance outcomes? Does IQ tell the whole story? What other factors have been shown to play a role in real-world performance?

› _Sample Answer_

IQ has been shown to correlate with career success, financial success, marriage stability, and avoiding jail. Other factors bear on real-world success too, such as personality traits, motivation and ambition, and culture.

3) Many researchers have proposed different constructs that they claim capture different factors in intelligence. Describe _Spearman's g_ and how it relates to the idea of intelligence. Compare and contrast _fluid intelligence and crystalized intelligence_ – what does each describe and how are they related?

› _Sample Answer_

_Spearman's g_ is a 'general factor' which is thought to underlie performance on a variety of different intelligence tasks. For example, performance on many subtests of intelligence are positively correlated (meaning that people with high scores on one tend to have high scores on the others); the overall degree of relatedness across tests is captured by _g_.

_Fluid intelligence_ is the ability to reason about novel problems without relying on specific past experiences; whereas _crystallized intelligence_ relies on applying specific past experiences and knowledge to problem solving. For example, fluid intelligence supports the ability to find a solution when familiar tools are unavailable, and crystallized intelligence supports the ability to recall facts or procedures that are related to a problem at hand. These intelligences work together. Fluid intelligence can draw on extensive crystallized intelligence by abstracting general principles that will work in new, previously unencountered situations.
