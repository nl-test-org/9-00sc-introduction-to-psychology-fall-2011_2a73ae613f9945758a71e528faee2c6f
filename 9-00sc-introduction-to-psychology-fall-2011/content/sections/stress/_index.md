Discussion: Stress
------------------

So, let's talk a little bit about the science of stress, the psychology of stress, and the physiology of stress. What's going on when you say, "I'm stressed out" – what does that mean from a biological and a cognitive perspective?… [Read more »]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/stress/discussion-stress)

Describe the three stages of Selye's _General Adaptation Syndrome_.

› _Sample answer_

The _general adaptation syndrome_ is comprised of three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. In the alarm phase, an organism prepares physiologically and psychologically to respond to a stressor. This includes the release of hormones like cortisol and the activation of the HPA axis. In the resistance phase, the organism mobilizes resources to adapt to the contiued presence of a stressor. This may include reducing non-essential metabolic activities in preference for those that support the stress response. Cortisol levels remain high during this phase if the stressor is chronic. In the exhaustion phase, the physiological cost of maintaining a heightened response to the stressor begins to take its toll. Resources may be diverted away from essential systems (cf. resistance phase) which cause damage to the body and brain.

What is hostility in the context of psychological science? What are some of the effects of hostility on health?

› _Sample answer_

_Hostility_ is a "personality trait associated with heart disease and characterized mistrust, an expectation of harm and provocation by others, and a cynical attitude." Hostile personality traits are present in individuals with a so-called "Type A personality." The heightened, chronic stress responses associated with hostility include high blood pressure and heart disease.

Coping strategies for handling stress can be either problem-focused or emotion-focused. Explain how these two approaches are different and similar. Identify general strategies that are examples of problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping.

› _Sample answer_

_Problem-focused coping strategies_ are those that seek to change the _external_ source of a stressor. This can include changing the environment itself, or changing how one interacts with the environment to avoid causing stress. Examples of general approaches to _problem-focused_ coping include _active coping_ (trying to remove or work around a stressor), _planning_ (developing strategies for managing a stressor), and _instrumental social support_ (seeking advice about specific actions from others), among others.

_Emotion-focused coping strategies_, meanwhile, are those that seek to change the _internal_ response to a stressor. Rather than trying to reduce or remove the cause of stress, these strategies attempt to change the emotional response to the stressor – how it is experienced by an individual. Emotion-focused coping strategies include _emotional social support_ (seeking affirmation and encouragement from others), _venting emotions_ (talking about stressed feelings to others as a means to feeling better), and _mental disengagement_ (trying to think about other, non-stressful things), among others.

Both emotion- and problem-focused approaches are viable methods for reducing stress.
