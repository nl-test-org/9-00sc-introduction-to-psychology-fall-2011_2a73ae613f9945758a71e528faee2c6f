How do we learn and use language in our everyday lives? How does the brain make this happen? This session explores the brain basis of language perception and comprehension, how language contributes to our understanding of our environment, and how we learn languages. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Keywords_: phoneme, speech, comprehension, hearing, writing, reading, phonology, syntax, evoked response potential (ERP), meaning, pragmatics, aphasia, language acquisition {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of [zinjixmaggir](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dilaudid/4954719152/) on Flickr (aka Markus Koljonen, [http://iki.fi/markus.koljonen](http://iki.fi/markus.koljonen))._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Discussion
----------

Language is just incredible – think about how easy it is for us, as babies, to learn our native language effortlessly, and yet how hard it is, once we’ve already learned a language, to learn another… [Read more »]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/language-1/discussion-language)

### Short Answer Questions

1) Language is a system of communication and representation that is governed by systematic rules. The rules of can be studied at multiple levels. For each of the following terms, identify the features of language they describe:

1.  Syntax
2.  Semantics
3.  Phonology

› _View/Hide Answers_

1.  Syntax: The description of how words are organized into phrases and sentences. Often called the "grammar" of a language.
2.  Semantics: The description of the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.
3.  Phonology: The description of the sounds of a language and how they are put together to make words.

2) Language is a powerful system because of the principle of discrete infinity, which means that a small number of basic units can be combined in an unlimited number of ways to represent and communicate ideas.

1.  What is the smallest unit of meaning in language called? Give an example of how these can be combined.
2.  What is the smallest contrastive unit of sound in language called? Give an example of one of these from English. Give an example of one of these from a foreign language you might have heard, but which is not present in English.

› _View/Hide Answers_

1.  Morpheme. For example: Un + believe + able = unbelievable
2.  Phoneme. For example: /k/ as in "cat" in English. In other languages but not English, e.g., the trilled "r" in Spanish, the clicks in Bantu, the trilled "r" in French, the hard "h" in Hebrew.

3) It is remarkable that babies learn language so fast and so effectively, even though no one ever explicitly teaches them the rules of their language. Describe two facts you have learned about how babies learn language.

› _Sample Answers_

*   Girls learn more words earlier than boys.
*   Babies begin to lose the ability to discriminate foreign language speech sounds by 9-12 months.
*   Children might use words wrong in overextensions (e.g. calling all animals "doggie") or underextensions (refusing to call any other dog besides the family pet a "doggie").
